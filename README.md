# Case Study: Optimizing MSU Library's User Experience

## Background
Explore the journey of Montana State University's library website transformation through an in-depth case study. Analyze user interactions and engagement metrics to optimize the user experience and enhance library services.

## Objectives
The project aims to analyze and enhance user engagement on the library's website, particularly focusing on improving the performance of the "Interact" button. Key questions include:
- What factors contribute to low interactions with the "Interact" button?
- How can the user experience be improved to increase engagement?
- What are the effects of renaming the "Interact" button to alternative titles?

## User Engagement Metrics (April 3 – April 10, 2013)
Click-through rate (CTR) for "Interact": 2%
Click-through rate (CTR) for alternative titles: Find (35%), Request (6%)

## Methodology
The project involves:
- Conducting A/B tests to evaluate alternative titles for the "Interact" button.
- Collecting user feedback through surveys to understand preferences.
- Utilizing statistical analysis, including chi-square tests, to determine significant improvements in user engagement metrics.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Statistical Analysis: scipy.stats
- Notebook Environment: Google Colab

## Expected Outcomes
The analysis will provide insights into optimizing the library website's user experience, leading to increased user engagement and improved access to library resources. Key metrics to track include click-through rates (CTR) and drop-off rates for category pages.
